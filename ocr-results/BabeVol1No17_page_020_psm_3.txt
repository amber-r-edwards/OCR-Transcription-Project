‘continued from page 2. Perverso attractions exist in hierarchies of men (typified in a certain kind of sick male homosexual relationship) and between men and women. The master and slave are each others "other half". The fragments long for each other in their longing for wholeness. (Autonomous people are already whole and are drawn to each other through affinity, whole attracted to whole.) For instance, a woman caught in the female role seeks an idealized, eroticized male figure. He personifies the limits of. her role. He is a split off part of her own being. (Vice versa) The figure of one's master or one's slave is linked with energy, excitement- pleasure and sex, contrasting with one's own experience of emptiness and low energy. PERVERSO COORDINATION is the attraction and relationship of fragments. This is one reason why it is so hard to destroy dominance, and real revolution means destroying dominance on all levels. By repeated association throughout our upbringings, our sexual feelings have been fixed on the very dominance patterns we need to destroy. People secretly in love with sickness are not very good at destroy- ing sickness. continued from page 7 Something like this is what Blake is putting into narrative form, using “humanized” figures to represent that Family of Eternal Powers. One member of the Family wearied of the continued activity of desire to give, of constant self-sacrifice, and drew away from his compeers, leaving a void. Altogether self-concerned, he was a new thing, an unknown factor (in Chapter I, Blake ‘repeats the word unknown five times, in the “annals”: of Eternity. Separated from the other Eternals, he sought, so to speak, to save himself by finding his Self. Instead, finding his Self, he lost his reality, becoming a shadow in a vacuum. He was no fonger the Ur-Reason, the Our Reason of Eternity, but Your Reason, a thing apart bounded by his self-made Horizon: : . Contemplating himself, he changed his function from qualita- ‘tive synthesis to quantitative analysis, spinning out of the bowels of his mind measurable shapes. It was not an act of creation because creation would produce the real, but the teal had existed eternally. What Urizen produced was the finite appearance which obscures and conceals the infinite real. Or, rather, since ‘Earth was not, nor globes of attraction,” he produced those conceptions of measurable shapes, which would later take physical form. Having these concep- tions, he sees himself as a Creator-God and foresees that, out of the void ‘over which he stretches self-balanced (but se/f-balance is a contradiction in terms—he is really falling like a one-winged bird), he will construct a universe. And so he will. The ‘many, all his manifested diverse conceptions, will be turned into one, certainly, but only because they are compelled to it by One command, one joy, one desire, é \ Somination ° One curse, one weight, one measure, One King, one God, one Law. His will be the unity of submissive obedience, not of collaborative equality. o O W. L. DIRECTORY $ -50 (NEW) Compiled by Jane Martelli. At last! a very comprehensive directory of W. L. groups .

Dec.1, 1970 -p. 19 MEDIUMS Alice Alta Bonnie Barbara Laurel Peggy Natalie Sonia Starr Sunny Curley The tragic irony of the situation is that Urizen, having sepa- tated from the One, seeks Oneness. What he fails to understand is that a dynamic unity is impossible without the, interaction’ of contra- ties. Joy could not know itself without pain; an unburning desire or imagination is a contradiction in terms; an unfluctuating solid would be lifeless. The fact is that the greater the contrast between the con- traries is, the more intense the consciousness is. But Urizen does not want intense consciousness; he wants the spiritual torpor of ‘‘holiness.”’ For him, everything half-dead is holy. It has got to be recognized that Urizen is not bad, as in Paradise Lost and the Divine Comedy Satan is. He is in Error. He is not, there- fore, thrown out of Heaven to be punished in an eternal Hell. No one is punished, but all suffer. The other Eternals, horrified observers of Urizen’s aberrant thought, and yet incapable—and undesirous— of a complete separation from him (their ‘salvation, like his, is in their ultimate reunification), respond immediately to counteract his “error. But, of course, themselves out of equilibrium, their response is not benevolently omnipotent. thologies.
