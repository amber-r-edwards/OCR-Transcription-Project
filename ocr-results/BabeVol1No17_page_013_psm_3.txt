It Aint Me Babe O alam ur-siiza (The knowledge of the ur-sisters is embodied in our flesh) Zihah el-urum otz (We embrace the knowledge of each cell.) Ur-siiza el-idritz (We call on the ur-sisters to speak) A silver chalice filled with tiny blue crystals was passed around the circle. Nombea-kalil cerhec ur-sturga (We partake of the crystal to see and hear our ancient sisters.) As she spoke these last words, the sister fell limp on the ground from the pressure of the ur-consciousness. absor- bing her. When at last she rose from trance her green eyes were luminous with knowledge. "Let us read the Mundi:della. They have pointed my mind to the necessary passages." From deep inside her robe she drew a copy of the Mundi:della (the sisterhood's Hidden Information or Ageless Wisdom). As she read her voice was deep and steady. "We are searching for the g:rden: the unity in which creativity existed instead of time. We live outside the garden--in â€˜an unnatural world of domination and com- plex systems of power. At some point in our evolution as a species human consciousness. was split into male-female. Organic differences became a matter of dominant and submis- sive, superior and inferior, male and fe- male, a top and a bottom. Hierarchy re- placed coordination. What can measure the destructiveness of this split in consciousness? Its es- sence is fragmentation--a process of sepa- ration and isolation and confusing the organic relationships of the parts. Our experience is mystified. The destruction becomes greater with time and the frag- ments multiply. Isolated pieces become balanced in a perverse coordination of rigid order--spreading from the basic dominant-submissive hierarchy of male over female to an intricate system of male supremacy-- layers of domination The passage was from the earliest chapter of the Mundi:della,The Domenerge, written by the ur-sisters during the last days of patriarchy. The sisters understood clearly now. The Domenerge was back, infecting the populace of Kyridion X. The organic coordinating cycle would have to be re- jeuvenated there somehow. And the answers lay in the Mundi: della. are diseased pyramidal structures with a few on top feeding off the energy of all layers below and with each layer ex- ploiting all the layers beneath it. This rigid power exchange, in all aspects of our life, forbids change. That is, any spontaneity, growth, co- ordination. Only the artists can be cre- ative. That's their monopoly, the frag- ment they control. And so we know what part of us always knew--we are not whole. Knowing this, we create alterna- tives. We must begin to search for the hidden information. All that was kept secret to prevent us from seeing alternatives. That is, from observing contradictions and the connectedness of the parts that is the creative process of synthesis. Part of this hidden information is to realize that we have been separated from our individual uniqueness and from our environment. Fragmented energies need to discover focussed personal affinities which in time will become an affinity cluster (or group). There are affinity clusters which already exist. These energy centers (some call themselves the Bene OE) are reaching out to join other clusters in order to coordinate greater and great- er wholes until domination is destroyed by coordination." will the This content downloaded from 76.210.38.222 on Tue, 25 Feb 2025 01:59:50 UTC All use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms Dec--1, 1970 p. 12 dread domenerae infeck the universe? see next issue |
