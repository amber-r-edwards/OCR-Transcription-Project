It Aint Me Babe Dec. 1, 1970 p. 4 @ Bay Area Kegtona onjerence Oo @ hevoluttonary People’s Constitutional Conventton met in Berkeley last Nov.14th & Lith to begin to work out tdeals and strategy for an emerging social order. What developed fram: the twenty-nine workshops was an exhtlerating sense of common consctousness The end result was a series of proposals that reflected in many ways the extent to which the high level of consetousness generated by the presence of a strong women's movement ts effeeting the direction of the revolutionary movement in this country.- Betow are major portions of three of those proposals. 1. Our revolutionary children are entrusted with the responsibility for rediscovering the true human nature, which has been per- verted by thousands of years of Racism, Capitalism, Sexism, Nationalism, and false religion. Forced limitations of their experience, in the name of protection and love, has always been a central part of reactionary repression, especially for the bourgeois class. The destruction of human potential for love by repression in childhood must end now. Children must be allowed self-regulation, encouraged to relate joyfully to their bodies without shame or sex-role prejudices, and their affectionate-sexual-sensual characters must be allowed full expression without so-called moralistic interference. Development, self-discovery, and free é expression of affection and exploration into revolutionary nonexploitative and non- oppressive new sexual forms of, life cannot occur where there is interference by ~ Imperialist Christian so-called morals, laws, ridicule, or guilt, or when children are systematically kept ignorant of the varieties of human joy and pleasure in one-another. Revolutionary people will no longer do the dirty work of Capitalist Pigs by crushing their children's’ free development to protect them from the oppressors and to make them fit peace- fully into the Capitalist System. ...instead we will crush Capitalism, and set all people free. Briss 2. We demand civil rights and liberties for children in no way inferior to: those accorded to. adults. We demand immediate liberation of all child-prisoners in’ the orphanages and so-called reform, schools. These children must be allowed to find their own place in the people's community. ‘Adults caring for them, communes, and” free children's collectives shall be supported without conditions limiting experimentation into.new social forms and structures. Non-exploitative variety vand choicé are,at the heart of the ' revolution. 3. Children are not property. No child shall be forced to stay within any Se! biological family if it does not suit co (see paragraph 5). Children must have the. chance to explore alternatives and to choose from a v Ariety of structures, combining what we now call family, school, work and apprenticeship, summer vacation, _etc. ‘The only final judge of the suit- “ability of a particular family or environ- ment for a particular child must be that | child. “In this period before the revo-__ lution there will undoubtedly be many situations in which the greater exper- ience of adults will teach them that some limitations on the freedom of the children must be made arbitrarily, to protect both the adults and the children from ~ reactionary repression. This need should be explained to the children and they should be taught from an early age the skills necessary for survival under repression, such as how to lie without embarrasment when questioned by oppressor pigs. In every revolutionary family the free- doms, of the individuals will be limited by the needs of other members and the whole ‘group, but we should always struggle to confine these limitations to rationally justified ones which are balanced by the advantages of membership in the group. Like adults, the child should be free to judge that balance for coself and if co desires, co should be free to seek alternative revolutionary family group to accept co, on co's terms. A child's revolt, violence, or thievery shows that the environment is not responsive to his Z icles, complaints, subsert- or her needs. Materialist needs are exagerated by capitalist advertising. The child's need for people can never be satisfied by the nuclear family alone, but an extended family is necessary. A richness of particular forms is expected in revolutionary society as a value in itself, but also important for testing and trial, since in our present state we are limited in our knowledge of third-world alternative forms (reported to us by Western chauvinist anthropolo- gists) and the. full impact of technology used for human purposes remains unexplored. 4. The free movement of children in the or) world, exploration of life-styles, city 5 and country, the forms of useful work and labor (true education), will be possible only if children are economically inde- 3 \ ven pendent. All children are entitled to their share of guaranteed income, fruit of the labor of all past generations. given to us in the form of the arts, sciences, technology, and capita], the last at present stolen from the People by the institutions of Capitalism. The child should control-cos food, shelter, and necesaary for the maximum development of individual talents which will finally benefit all humankind. 5. We. urge all 6f our revolutionary brothers and: sisters to: become aware that the emotional overtones of Imperialist Language have a :strong effect in condition- ing children's minds to oppression, in- stilling Western chauvinism and ‘cultural prejudices.

It is no accident that weshave. been. tricked into using words “like fuck, prick, ‘cunt; motherfucker, cock~- , sucker, or asshole»as insults. Fucking is “* “beautiful and the body is. beautiful, but when we use. these words as insults. we . teach the children that their bodies are shameful-and revolutionary love .filthy (as Agnew. would say). Sexism.is so deep in our society. that it-is a part of the language, ..and in the recomendations, here we have avoided.the. sexist use. of masculine personal, pronouns.,like;"'he'' or. "his", eee when we really means children of both sexes. ‘ “We have adopted the alternative, Indo- European root word '"co!', as: suggested by Mary . Orovan of the New York Radical Femin- ists. In this usage, where Imperialist Language would use “he'’, meaning "he or she'', !'co''.is used. ''Co!' is also used in place of "him" (for him-her), with the context making the difference clear. The old possessive "his" (for his-hers) .is replaced by "cos" and "coself" replaces "himself. Humankind replaces mankind.
