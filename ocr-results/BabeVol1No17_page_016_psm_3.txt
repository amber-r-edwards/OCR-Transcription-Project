ON SUB ' Man is the only animal that con- sciously seeks and utilizes energy other than that of his own body. First beasts od burden supplemented his muscles, then water and windmills, and the sailboat. But the wind does not always blow, and running water is not everywhere available. MAN(and thats men he's talking aboutm, not women; we have been left out of how such things are decided and done: an unhealthy un- balance of energe.—Babe) NEEDED A SOURCE OF POWER THAT WAS INDEPENDENT OF SPACE AND TIME. " ae That quote is from "The Concept of Energy Simply Explained" by Morton Mott-Smith, Dover, 1964. As with many. such books, read between the lines for the real information. Independent of time and space indeed. No such thing. The ability to manipulate the space and time of other creatures on this planet, yes. The ability to speed up processes (progress is our most important product) to the point that the planet may be near distruction. Speed kills. It is a male supremicist trip. But part of.one always is in real time, so there is inter- nal conflict. There is a linguist who says the verb "to be" is evil (a perverso mechanism/ dynamic) because it allows one to lie. To say that something is something else. Like, time is money. Time cannot be mani- pulated, but money can. So money is a really bad trip. It must go. But anyway, this is only-one mechanism. It is import- ant that we isolate out such mechanisms so that we can better understand the exact, real way our society runs. Rather than the mystifmcations we are beclouded by. It is equally important that we begin to isolate and collect the human(woman) knowledge that has been fragmented in the process of the buildup of this perverso society. Those ''things" that have been "lost'', Lost already being a mystify- ing way of describing a process of control that begins at (or even before) birth. The suppression of infantile “sexuality'"' being a gross example. "Lost! mechanisms begin to appear. Consider subvocalization. It is the process of saying words, making sounds, without being audible. By subvocalizing, you can create sound in your head - sound that has depth, is resonant. This means that your vocal cords can make any sound. OCALIZ Aon Teo N STORRS SL I have found that id if I make (imitate) the sound of another person with my vocal cords, I have a better understanding of where that person is coming from. I exper- ience that person. I can also get sensitive to the difference between what that per- son says and thinks/feels. Thus it is that women get dragged off to nut houses for saying their husbands plot in their th thoughts to kill them. Again, this is only one mechanism. What is especially interesting about subvocalizationis that it is a tool, a human ability that is brutally suppressed in this society. Most people would admit to masturbating and nose-picking first. Everyone knows that only morons have to move their lips when reading, which is how they spot that you''re subvocalizing.. Crafty types (paranoids) learn to cut down on lip motions - we like to hang~on to survival mechanisms. When people . take speedreading courses, they are told to hold their hands on their throat, so they'll notice when they subvocalize and Stop it. Certain books only became access- ible to me when i subvocalized them while reading; heard and felt the phrasing, tone, pitch of the mind that put out those words. (It is the sound that communicates the feeling, the word, the concrete picture. Unless the word is a latin "ab- stract'': a word invented to manipulate one's understanding of reality. So does slaveowner become employer.) Gertrude Stein is one such writer. And some poets. Subvocalize as much as possible. When reading, listening to music, or people talking. It is possible that the vocal cords also serve some kind of receiver/trans- mitter function. I have no doubt that people are more or less aware of the thoughts we think about them. Laing and Doris Lessing (Four Gated City) and a lot of women know about that. So why cannot this ability be used in a positive way? This is part of the feminist revolution. ——_— Commu NICAT/O01V/ —— Laing was the first out front articulat ion I'd ever heard of certain beliefs, feelings many of us have held secretly for years. His was the first unmistak- eable 20th century voice to be encouraging. William Burroughs has probably taken us to the edge in understanding the perverso dynamics of-this society. People like Laing and Doris Lessing , to mame only 2, are starting to put the positive things together. There is much to be learned/remembered/be unafraid of from reading such people. Here's a quote from Lessing: (it starts with Lynda, who is "crazy" talking): but the thing is, we've got it all wrong, we say, men invent machines, but we make machines to do what we can do ourselves. If we didn’t have the machines and someone told us, You don’t need ma- chines, it’s in your minds, you don’t need computers, there are human computers, perhaps we’d never have to make the machines. What do we need machines for? To dig ditches and make roads, but our brains could be rockets and space probes, if they can be radios and television sets.” All this in a fast low voice, a murmur, while she swayed back and forth from side to side. It was the monotone self-absorbed murmur of madness, for she did not really care if Martha answered her or not. Or perhaps the even monot onous tone was a way of keeping herself on an even keel, as Martha did not speak or she maintained her voice on a level So as not to jar away the pictures. Or perhaps the murmur was a way of saying to Martha: Don't this way of taining is @ way of thinking, I find out what I think when I But if Lynda had spoken thus before a nurse in a mental hospital, before a psychiatrist, they would have said: “Mrs. Coldridge is badly confused today.” Martha said: “But if the human brain could be @ space probe or a moon-walker or a radar, it could also be a bomb or a disintegrator, and people would use it to destroy, they aren’t fitted.” THIS 1S THE HEAVY (NFO; IT 1S CONCRETE This content downloaded from 76.210.38.222 on Tue, 25 Feb 2025 01:59:50 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms It Aint Me Babe Dec. 1, 1970 p-45
