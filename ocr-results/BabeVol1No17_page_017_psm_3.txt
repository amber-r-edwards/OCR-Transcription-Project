ACT III Two Weeks Later Office of the Chamber of Commerce (Walter enters distraught. Steady chant of "Strike, strike, strike" in background) WAL: My fellow Americans--at this moment we face a serious challenge to our free, competitive way of life. » Manage- ment has three choice of how to respond. One, we could do nothing, and be destroyed. Management has rejected this option. Two, we could unlease all the mighty forces at our disposal, and destroy everybody. We don't like that one either. Or three, we can do what I intend to do. This may not be the easy way, but it is the right way. Let me make one thing perfectly clear. In this crisis, management will not behave like a pitiful, helpless giant.. We will behave like a merciless and cunning giant, and God help the under- dog. (Doorbell rings) Aha--our operation begins. Miss Jones! (Doorbell rings again) Miss Jones! (Rings again) Miss J--dagnab it! I keep forgetting. Come in! : (Enter John, totally dishevelled. Walter sniffs at a bad smell.) JOH: Forgive my appearance sir, I had to come through the sewers. WAL: Take off the coat, Beefheart! JOH: Er--it"s Cartfart, sir. WAL: - Cartfart? JOH: Er-Heartfart! No--Heartright! That's it. WAL: Well, Heartcart, you know why I've sent fdr you? JOH: Something to do with the...strike? WAL:. They've got 100,000 women on strike. It's cost this city $10,000,000 so far. Money that could have been spent on poverty programs. Money that could have cleaned our polluted environment. . JOH: And because of my relationship with—- 'WAL: Money that now is rotting in the banks! We can!t mov it! For the first time in my life, I can't make anything happen! - sf JOH: Sir, there is one thing I must say—- WAL: Money-- JOH: As Gloria's (sighs) former fiance, my first loyalty must be-— : ’ WAL: Money that could have doubled the salary of every man in this city! ss JOH: --to the American way of life! WAL: I never doubted it, son. Let's be realistic and con- sider where those women would lead us. Free abortions, free telephones, free transportation, free child care-- free Bobby! Equal work, of course, is out of the question. You can't put men in those jobs. JOH: Men wouldn't take them! This can't mean you're going to give in? WAL: Not completely--after all, we still own everything. But it does mean we can't get around equal pay. We'll have to cut men's salaries. JOH: You couldn't cut--profit? WAL: You mean capital expansion? Are you suggesting we castrate the American eagle? DEPEMDENT PEMAL JOH: I wasn't thinking. WAL: You'd better start, my boy--their bargaining committee will be here any minute. JOH: All right, sir--tell me what I must do. (Walter whispers; John briefly protests, but is convinced) WAL: That's it, son. (Doorbell rings) The enemy's trumpet: Into my inner office. . Be square, my boy;' and obey the law of the pack. (John exits with Boy Scout salute) Scene ii (Sarah and Gloria enter) WAL: Good morning! Are you girls looking for work? GLO: Equal work! WAL: So this is the bargaining committee. It's an honor to meet two such dedicated ladies. (To Gloria): You look like a dangerous adversary! (Aside): She would be--if we were alone! SAR: Spare us your compliments. You know our demands. WAL: Yes: "Free everything." I find them excessive. Management is prepared to make a generous offer. (Aside) : I wouldn't care to be alone with this one! GLO: Pretty generous, giving us what we've won! WAL: Spunky--I like that! (Aside): Where have I seen a face like that before? SAR: (to Gloria): It seems your appeal has reached manage- ment. GLO: Ugh--I hate older men! WAL: Who is tidying the home? Who is washing the clothes, who is taking care of junior, while women are out parading in the streets? Management doesn't think any man should have to carry two jobs, so is acting fast to bring women back to their posts.
