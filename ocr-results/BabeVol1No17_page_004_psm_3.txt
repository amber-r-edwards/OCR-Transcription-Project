PLANET IN CRISIS The essence of healthy, organic life is a process of ever greater synthesis and growth--energy. At some point the human race broke off from this healthy state it once shared with the rest of organic nature. Human behavior and experience is sick. It is like a spreading cancer, destroying not only humanity but also nature. We see two forces in opposition: Life/Energy/Synthesis vs. the Cancer. Life today is at a low energy level because the cancer is destroying its essence. Organically, energy synthesizes greater and greater wholes, creates greater and greater spheres of coordination. The process is the’same as in physical coordination-- in human society it would mean organic co- ordination of energies among persons, and ‘for each individual a growing organic coor- dination of personal faculties. The effect of the cancer is just the opposite. The cancer destroys coordination. It blocks synthesis. ‘The cancer can be called Domination. Domination, like a smashing hammer, also means fragmentation. When you: are prevented from making your own syntheses, you remain unsynthe- sized, fragmented. _ Organic coordination involves relation- ship. All parts must be in full. relation- ship to each other and to their totality (the whole). Synthesis and coordination are the essence of creativity and all the arts. Synthesis is pleasure--ecstacy. In life, total creativity and spontaneity.” Domination is the ecstacy block, the energy block. Domination means hierarchy. Today in all respects except for sym- 2. pathetic media coverage, we have the same situation hitting the masses of women; we are organizing and mobili- zing: We are militant and visible. And every day,many women in the Bay 3. Area are subject to unprovoked attack. Women of the Free Future, a Berkeley Women's Liberation group, is present- _ing nine practical demands for elimina- ting rape by minimizing the environ- mental conditions which make it 4 relatively easy for rape to occur. We are calling for a full-scale night time: city Council meeting hearing’ on 5. the problem of rape, to take place not more than one month from now. We want the City Council to provide ade- quate child care on the premises for all parents who need it. The one month is a grace period to determine how far and how fast the Council will move on these crucial proposals for solving the outrage of rape. Our demands are: 1. Free, frequent public bus transpor- tation for all women from dusk to dawn.

We love those who give us pleasure, with whom we can generate the most energy. As we strip away the lay- ers of domination in our heads--all the “shoulds" and "shouldn'ts", all the rules, every premise we accepted that did not.’ grow organically in our understanding-- .we get more in touch with our affinities. We see our attractions. Where we want to go. - and where we don't. Energy takes its own course. ; The affinity group is our idea of orga- nic social form. In an affinity group, peo- ple are involved with each other because of mutual involvement in a synthesizing process, out of real mutual’ coordination, on the basis of healthy attractions. An affinity group would be a unity-- a coordinating, integrating whole, generat- ing a tremendously high energy level. 5 .

That taxpayers' money be diverted from the Berkeley police budget ‘into a fund to hire a staff of wo- men trained in the psychology of rape. That these women will accom- pany the police on the initial inves- tigation of all rape reports. (This is done in other countries.) . That further funds be diverted from the Berkeley police budget into the hands of all the Women's Liberation groups in berkeley to initiate and maintain public self defense classes for all women in Berkeley.
