It Aint Me Babe Dec. 1, 1970 p. 14 It is clear that men must change; change LETTER behavior, priotities, attitudes...it is clear to us that change of/in the oppresse is different from change of/in the TRANS- O (Yes, yes, men oppress each other and are oppressed by the society, but all men oppress all women; that there are roles is oppressive, and men benefit from these UR RESPOWSE roles ing the planet in the oppressed. . SEX VAL ag willingly. Dear Sisters, As you webl know, one of the least logical putdowns of women who demand their human rights devised by the self styled Llogteal sex is"they want to be men". You also know that particular ptece of : also know that particular statement to be a load of crap. I am a transsexual. On the intellect- ual and emotional levels, I know myself to be a woman; on the physteal Level, my own body dentes me this. (he deseribes his background) ...but here (SF State) I also met Bev. She was different from any girl I'd ever known before - she was a person. She did not play the role-games society demands, and more than women - and are destroy- The oppresser does Rgg not change process.) "When a creature has develop ped ‘into one thing, he will ° choose death rather than change into his opposite." --from Dune Prophet, by Frank Herbert i That is the situation of Amerika and of individual men, The way it is now, women are all the things men dont want to be. If the sex act involves a kind of merging, with what has be come an opposite, therefore, ‘§dangerous, how can it be other than anathema, a "thrill". And yes there is the danger that this will also be the case between two women, having all those responses and habits built in by now. this was one reason I fell tin love with her. This was two years ago and we've been good friends ever since. ‘Bev had the effect of a catalist on me. When we met she was beginning to “come out" and this dealt a fatal blow to whatevr male ego I'd been conditioned to have. She turned me on to my own bisexuality, which led me to realtze that all life I'd giv. en a woman's love? whitch he Ted me to re- altze flash on the idea that tf I really were female, despite my body, then my life made sense, whereas it made no sense other wise. ° This soctety does not value or recognize a woman's human personality, espectally when tt ts trapped in a man's body. I have already had the chance to live as a woman, and it further convinced me of my femininity. This January I met a woman named Mary at a Gay Lib coffee house. Having a common interest in folk music, we became friends. (I've always fitted in with gay women but not wtth gay men. This makes sense to me now, but used to be con fusing. ) When I told her I'd dectded I was a transsexual, she dug the idea and said she could really see my being a woman. Come the summer, and she invited me to visit in her apartment. I found myself aee epted as a woman for the first time tn my life. It was womderful. In the words of Van Morrison; Mary could make me "feel so free, make me feel like me", I let down my defense mechanisms and even with. my grotty glasses and all, I was constdered a woman almost everywhere I went. I must have looked pretty butehy, but I was accepted as a woman without even trying. And I loved tt. sa a i The climax came when Mary and I fell in love. Her advances freaked me out at first, I was so afraid that I would be a disappot ntment to her because of my body, as she ts exclusively gay. But she was able to see beyond my body, loving me for the : person t am (see, male chauvinists - tt ts ‘possible - try tt sometime.) Making love was a strange mixture of the joy of giving and receiving love and the. frustration of. having to put up with my body in tts present state. i os At the time of this writing I am ~~. seeing a pshrink to get his recommenda- tion to start estrogen treatment as a pre- paration for sex-change surgery. : Love, Beth | @. A woman's love. A woman, especially a woman-identified woman, has some idea(and it clarifies every day) of t what that means. It is every detail of life, how it goes down, what the priorities are. It is daily life, something men in general are unfamiliar with, not having lived it. , — BABE It is only "trapped" when the "man" in the body feels there is a contradiction. It does of course contradict what society imposes, and any such man will be penalized. He will be called Transsexual and treated as ill. He will be offered castration. The feminist revolution is accept the body and destroy the society. ~ BABE co make a coarse; working generalization: There are three kinds of men in our society: homosexual men straight men who are more or less successful in the male role straight men who are more or less unsuccessful in the male role. Of the three, homosexual men may be said to carry male supremacy a step farthu than straight men. They dispense with women altogether. It is a working adaptati on. The key part being that they adapted. They are an integral part of the system. Those men who have been the least successful in the male role or an adap- tation of it are the ones for whom change will be more possible. Of course, these wiil probably be men who are now ignored by other men, and by man-indentified women. ®. This we don't dig at all as a solu- tion. It is a perverso solution; born of the dynamic that created the society in the first place. That's what most things are that men decide to do to "help". -g46é This content downloaded from 76.210.38.222 on Tue, 25 Feb 2025 01:59:50 UTC All use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms We say that to change a man must exper tenee being a woman. Must imttate women. In short, stop being men. This ts what this young man (Beth) wants to do, but he cops out by inststing tt can be done only in a female body. P. S.: Imitation is a real way to learn. To control us, it ts severely repressed and directed in this soctety. So closely ts the male role tted to tdentity that even a man whose head ts woman chooses death (sex change) over aeceptance of change. We decided to print this letter because it shows the seriousness of the problem. But we talked to the young man first. Partially to check out his vibes, parttally to see tf he would change his mind about the sex change. So he dropped in to vistt. There was a softness/relaxedness about him that felt good; a gtving, a nonstiffness. He did not try to dominante with body english or votce as so many men do, nor did he look through us or patently cope with us as so many homosexual men do. He did not push/ pull against our reality. We could see that: he was into a higher form of behavtor although his tdea/understanding of woman was tpo man-tdentified, too passive/sub- missive. He still tended to talk in generalizatt ons and abstracts, but tt was as though there was only one level of nonunder- standing to get through instead of the customary 2 or 3. And, to be sure, t he was sttll in’ the position of the male getting attention from women. Any kind betng better than none. (Men must learn to cope for them selves and teach each other. ) Our conversation went around like this: us: We can dig where you're coming from, but we think getting a sex change opef ation ts a cop-out. We women are disco- vertng, making strong, a new reality. Men must start doing the same. You have started. Stick with tt. By having a sex change operattonyou are saying that a per- son tn a male body cannot be a human. We do not accept that as a healthy solutton. he: The only way I can live as a woman, that ts, behave as a woman, ts to be totally female. us: Maybe that was true til about a. YEAR AGO, BUT NOW NEW REALITY WOMEN ARE EMERGING and wtll reinforce you; the more you go through your changes, the more meshing with us will be posstble. And during the same time you can try finding other men who can be tn your reality, although they might not have thought of the label "transsexual" to identify them- selves. he: But basically I don''t ltke my body... us: It shouldn"t matter whether one is born with female or male genttalta. That's our point. As your new realtty emerges, as you are able to live tt to any degree, you should be able to feel. differently. about your body. THan That"t what happens to us. He began to agree that tt was certainly worth trying, and tf what we say starts to happen, will not have the operation. We shall see what happens. If any men want to get tn touch with him, write care of thts paper.
