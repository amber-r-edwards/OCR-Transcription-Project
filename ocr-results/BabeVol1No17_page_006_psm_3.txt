We affirm that all people are sensual, Sexual and compassionate beings and shouldn't be labeled as hetero- homo- bi- or asexual. And that to ‘restrict sexuality is a denial of the freedom of each person's self-determination. We feel that all dimensions of unex- ploitative sexuality are good! The socialization of children in a revolutionary society involves the teaching of creative thought and persuance of collective interests and not the reinforcement of sexual role models. We as women are struggling to free our- selves from a male dominated and defined ideology. In this society certain roles have been Maintained. The present roles women and men have been socialized into reinforces the capitalist systems which thrives on competition and alienation from oneself an: and other human beings. Sex roles negate half of each person's potential. Ina role-free society women's aggressions, ” / ix strengths, and intellect would be actual- ized, as would men's sensitivity and emotions. In such a society there would be an end to men's alienation from emotions and inability to relate to children and children's openness. Men should take equal responsibility “for child care, whether in centers, col- lectives, or extended families. If the "other half'' of men would be developed they could relate to children. . Women must be trained so they can take responsibility for their other half- we need training in carpentry, plumbing, auto mechanics and everything else which has been denied women. Housework is socially necessary, productive labor.~ Men and women have equal responsibility for the maintenance of the household and the care of children. We want maternity and paternity leaves with pay. 7 Children are people and must be loved as sisters and brothers, not as infer- iors, not to-be programmed into sex roles. All adults are responsibile to all children and should relate to them with revolutionary love- not. domination or possession. All people should be free to choose living forms. We encourage people to. relate collectively. We see value in sharing work, having many adults for children to relate to, many children to relate to, many. people to relate to. We demand an end to all laws reinforcing the nuclear family or prohibiting any living arrangements among people.. In a revolutionary society sex can not be a determining factor in jobs.’ All types of work must be divided equally and col- lectively. We demand non-discrimination in clothing. Anybody can wear anything she or he wants (or nothing). All clothing must be well made, and of equal quality. We women must have control over our own bodies: as an end to alienation from our own bodies, we demand and take responsibil- ity for training in self-defense; we demand non-competitive, nonchauvinistic physical fitness programs for all from childhood; birth control, abortions and steriliza- tion available on demand, but none of these measures shall be forced on any woman. We feel that women relate to pregnancy “and child birth with more empathy than men, and therefore should be medically trained to be midwives, give abortions, etc. in free clinics controlled by patients. We believe in self-determination over one's body for everyone,. including freedom to change sex. We demand total mobility for everyone; an end to harrassment, rape, etc., through self-defense.and consciousness | raising. (The brothers also raising the . consciousness of other brothers). We demand an end to rape, and to the need for prostitution: no more sex as a commodity!! Sex and compassion are part - of every human person. Revolution= the withering away of sex roles! -as long as this does not infringe.upon the rights of others. It Aint Me Babe Dec. 1, 1970 p. 5 Mowers orkshor saceual Self Delermmahon, ane Be ee Goy Roop ee AUTONOMY--" The’ People's government shall recognize and encourage the people's right to realize their own potential in any way they see fit This includes their right to explore and express their sexual nature both in their choice of sexual partners, and their self-presentation in terms of dress and gender modification in any time and place of their own choosing. Our government shall be one which encourages all people to relate lovingly to one another regardless of gender. All educational, psychiatric, and religious institutions shall be structured so as“to recognize these principles. SELF-DETERMINATION-- All previously oppressed people will keep the right to reject the authority of the centrai state until they feel they are fully a part of that state and are willing to surrender their autonomy to it. To insure this, oppressed people must have both full participation in, and a veto power over the state, including political, military, industrial, educational, social welfare, judicial, media, and conmunicative institutions. Moreover, language shall not be used as 4 vehicle to assert the primacy of on gender over another. All oppressed peoples will be entitled to reparations in terms of the economic, techinical, and educational resources of the total society until they feel that they are no longer at a disadvantage in comparison with their former oppressors, both in terms of their material situation, and in terms of a sense of their own historical and cultural idenity. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT-- The state shall no longer recognize the nuclear family as a legal or social institution. The people shali have the right to live together in combinations of any number, sex, or age of people, or to live alone. All such living units will be equal before the law. No institution of the state shall be a symbolic modei of the nuclear family such as the First Family of the nation. 3 ; Children should have control over who raises them. They should only be cared for by. peopie they love and whose guidence they request. These people should represent the interests of third world people, gays, and other oppressed groups and have regular consultations with them. Children have the right to develope in a non-racist, non-sexist, non- possessive atmosphere and to educate themselves about the entire range of human sexuality through the free use of the people's educational facilities.
