THE REVOLT OF URIZEN'” The Background William Blake has been said to be, and not to be, a mystic, a pantheist, an occultist, a Neoplatonist, a Swedenborgian, an Arian, and a Christian. Speaking for himself, Blake sad that he believed the Bible and professed himself a Christian. But the most superficial reading of Blake’s prose and poetry shows him not to have been an institutional Christian nor a fundamentalist reader of the Bible. He thought that it would be a lasting witness against both Jews and Christians that they assumed an exclusive right to the benefits of God; he believed that the word of God was universal and that every man might ‘‘converse with God & be a King & Priest in his own house.” Blake was catholic but not Catholic; protestant but not Protestant; and not a proponent of Christianity, an organized religion associated with the state, but a believer in what might be called Jesus-sanity, a faith arrived at by the individual conscience. Such a definition, of course, is so broad as to permit considera- tion of Blake as either Christian or heretic. But in Blake’s opinion, to be a Christian in God's sight entails being a heretic in the Church’s. Convinced that this was so, Blake disavowed the Church and affiliated himself with that unorganized “‘theterodoxical’’ faith which, despite the Church’s constant opposition, has so well maintained its tradition that it deserves recognition as the Other Orthodoxy. In its comprehensive, faction-encompassing scope, this faith has no name, It cannot be called Protestantism because it protests as much against ‘the respectable Protestant churches as against the Catholic. It cannot be thought of as heresy except in the way that treason is thought treason when it fails to prosper. Yeats referred to it as ‘“‘hete- todox mysticism,’ but this is a clumsy term and, in its emphasis upon the single element of mysticism, too narrow. Huxley’s phrase, The Perennial Philosophy, is as broad as Yeats’s is narrow, and , /equally clumsy.» - Pethaps no term will suffice. But among the various alternatives - that present themselves, the word gnosticism seems to possess the greatest descriptive:force. As a religious movement in the early days of the Christian era, Gnosticism enjoyed a moment of influence, but, unable to organize its forces, soon faded out of contention. The move- ment was aberrational. But the gnostic point of view was not. In his Great Heresies and Church Councils, Jean Guitton finds it a way of thinking that has always existed and always will exist, stemming “from a fundamental attitude of the human mind,” and notes evi- dence of its influence upon Philo, Plotinus, Spinoza, and Hegel, among others, upon religions other than the Christian, and, in the twentieth century, upon existentialists, Jungian psychoanalysts, theoso- phists, and surrealists. 1 Taking the word in this broad sense, gnosti- cism is not necessarily a philosophical system like Neoplatonism, and a man may be a gnostic without knowing that at one time Gnostics did devise systems. The twentieth-century Gnostic, William Kings- land, says of Boehme that “. . . although uninstructed and unini- tiated in any of the Mystery schools—[he} saw, by his own natural faculty, those same deep truths which are taught in those Schools.” 2 The Gnostics, though they varied in specific points, tended to agree in the following general beliefs: They posited. an original spiritual unity which came to be split into a plurality. For man, the universe is a vast prison. He is en- slaved both by the physical laws.of nature and by such psychic laws as the Mosaic Code. Since the whole universal effort is to restore the wholeness and unity of the godhead, active rebel- lion against the moral law of the Old Testament is enjoined upon every man. Law states it very plainly: . . . there is no evil, no guilt, no deformity in any creature, but in its dividing and separating itself from something ‘which God had given to be in union with it. This, and this alone, is the whole nature of all- good and evil in the crea- ture, both in the moral and spiritual world, in spiritual and material things. 3° Thus it may be said that “‘as the devil is nothing but a fire-spirit broken off from its angelical light and glory, so hell is nothing but the fire of heaven separated from its first light and majesty.” 3! It Aint Me Babe Dec. ES 19708 i pan7 The stoty is as follows: Before the beginning, before Time and Space were, there was a dynamic unity of an unspecified number of eternal energies. It was not an undifferentiated One; nor was it a loose collocation of varied entities. It was what Lavater called Beauty — ‘the MOST VARIED ONE, THE MOST UNITED VARIETY.” 36 It was before the beginning, is now — at least potentially — and ever shall be, world without end, but being inconceivable, it is inexpressible, save by analogy. ecoxde OKi ON ine way of visualizing it is as a human body in which all the various parts unselfconsciously work in harmony together. There are brain, heart, loins, and skeletal structure, each quite different from the other, all, however, forming One Man. There are reason, imagi- nation, passion, and instinct, each serving its peculiar spiritual func- tion, all united as a Four-in-One, 37 in a state of mutual giving and receiving, a state in which each, moved by the desire to give of his bounty, continually dies deaths of self-sacrifice to be ré-vitalized by the others’ givings. The One Man does not know himself as merely a Unity nor as merely a Variety. His senses can be either expanded or contracted. When they are expanded, he sees himself as the One who comprises Many; when they are contracted, as the Many com- prising the One. That is, he can see himself in his totality; he can also recognize the minute particulars of which the totality is made. 38 Thus this One Man (who is the “myriads of Eternity’) is characterized by infinite comprehension, infinite energy, infinite love, and infinite freedom. But infinite freedom for every part of the whole means no less than that any part can remove from the whole. Given infinite energy, any one of the major powers might, using the means of contraction, so narrow its infinite comprehension as to lose sight of the totality in its preoccupation with its own particularity. This occurring, infinite love becomes contracted to self-love. That is to say, Eternity is not a stasis but a process. The powers are not alike; they are contraries in constant dialectical opposition producing progressive movement by maintaining’ a dynamic equili- brium. But if one of the powers endeavors to isolate: itself from its contrary, the dialectical process is altered, the dynamic equilibrium destroyed. It is as though one wing of a bird decided not to co- operate with its opposite fellow. Or, more aptly, since Eternity is like a human being, as if the head decided to detach itself from the lower members of the body and go it alone. In either case there would be a Fall. Wisdom is not per se evil; nor is Imagination (or Love) 39 in and of itself good. There is no need to import such moralistic terms at all. The fact is this: when these two (and the other powers with them) collaborate, Eternity is, as a variegated but undivided state; when they do not collaborate, Eternity still is—but malfunctioning because divided as well as variegated. It is always there, as an engine is still there, though, because the timer is askew, it operates fitfully. An adjustment will at once produce the Harmony — the radical Innocence — which is Eternity. continued on page 19 This content downloaded from 76.210.38.222 on Tue, 25 Feb 2025 01:59:50 UTC All use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms
