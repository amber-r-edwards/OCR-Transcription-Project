It Ain't Me Babe Dec. 1, 1970 p.9 BEND The silver Kyridion travelling dome glided through the pine forest that en- circled the Bene OE affinity-complex and ‘came to a shaky rest in full view of the complex's fabled towers. The pilot Yul- Shara stepped off the dome into the lush gardens and inhaled the perfumed air; it was the first moment of calm she had tas- ted since her escape from Kyridion X. Ky- ridion X ! she shuddered as her mind in- toned the name of her home planet. vibratory tewer ocmeeee IT AIN'T ME BABE SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT pee 1. VOYAGE 10 TZZADA But she was safe now, on Earth, at Tzzada, home of the Bene OE. Slowly, she started the walk towards the eight round towers carved from Bryllian alabaster. Unlike any towers she had-seen before, each was sculpted into the vibratory image of a Bene OE energy axiom. To gather strength in her purpose Yul Shara drew out her charred and tattered copy of the Bene OE's Mundi-Della and . “chanted its axioms aloud: Axiom 1: Energy is a system of re- lated and coordinated parts which produces a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts. Axiom 2: There are different levels of energy. The variables that deter- mine this range are A. the number of parts involved B. the coordination between the parts. Axiom 3: The human organism is a sy- stem of coordinated parts capable of generating a certain range of energy levels. - Axiom 4: Energy seeks higher levels (more and more synthesis, greater and greater wholes). ORGANIC PROCESS AX- IOM COROLLARY: Dominance occurs when energy is obstructed from its natural flow. Axiom 5: Organically, human organ- isms are attracted to the points of highest energy. - Axiom 6: When functioning organic- . ally (in a situation where there is coordination rather than dominance) two human organisms generate more energy than one. Axiom 7: Organically, humans are so- cial, are attracted to other humans. Axiom 8: The Affinity Group. Organ- ically, humans are most attracted to other humans with whom they are capa- ble of generating the most energy (that is, with whom they are capable of maximum coordination).
