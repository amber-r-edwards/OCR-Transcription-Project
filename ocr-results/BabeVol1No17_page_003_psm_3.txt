Domination has a coordination of its own. So we gave it a name--PERVERSO COORDINATION. For examples think of the coordination in the military. D fl N E W Alot of our readers and some staff members have been concerned that the Babe does not contain enough news. A couple of us have been thinking alot about what news is. : News is supposed to be important events. But who determines what is "important''? sible, physical action. But women going through changes that are not always out wardly visible is important to us. the LA Times and the Chicago Daily News etc. 2 <79St. San°Francisco,. | _NEWS REd EFINEd @x are a trip into one kind of reality-- News is supposed to mean outward, vi- The Chronicle and the Examiner and DISAR A 26 year old San Francisco woman was kidnapped by two men--one identified as a Berkeley fireman--early today and was freed when a Highway patrolman stopped their speeding car on the Bay Bridge.

The rape victim is always mute, hence an ob- ject devoid of intrinsic value. All images of the victim are either pro- vided by the listener's imagination or the witty asides of a police cap- tain or journalist. Never do we hear the victim's story. Whether this glar- ing continual omission is intentional or inadvertant is immaterial. The effect of spotty-coverage is to perpe- tuate crime, to sanction it in. silence rather than put the spotlight on it so that it may cease. In the late fifties the media committed itself to revealing the atrocities committed against black people in the south. The civil rights struggle succeeded, with the essential help of the sympathetic media. Castrations and lynchings could no longer be tol- erated by "civilized people". Black people themselves refused to tolerate brutal assaults. They became armed and militant in their own self defense. Whites, in turn, put peer pressure on their own community to eliminate the most outward trappings of racism, such as name-ca Jling.
