# OCR Transcription Demo: Late 1960s and 1970s Zines

This repository is a demonstration of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) transcription techniques applied to late 1960s and 1970s zines. Zines, often self-published and grassroots in nature, provide a unique glimpse into the countercultural movements, activism, and creative expression of the time. This project showcases how OCR technology can be used to digitize and analyze these historical documents.

## Features

- **OCR Processing**: Extracts text from scanned zine images using Tesseract OCR.
- **PDF to Image Conversion**: Converts multi-page PDFs into individual images for OCR processing.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes extracted text for patterns, themes, and metadata.
- **Event Extraction**: Identifies and categorizes events (e.g., protests, meetings) mentioned in the zines.
- **Publication Metadata**: Links extracted text to publication metadata (e.g., volume, issue, source publication).
